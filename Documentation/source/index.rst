About
=====

Our goal is to provide automated migrations for TYPO3 updates, as much as possible.

This should include source code modifications like adjusting old legacy class names to new ones and
providing a list of deprecated calls.

The official project home page can be found at https://git.higidi.com/Automated-TYPO3-Update/automated-typo3-update .
Please open new issues and merge requests there. You can login with your Github account.

Github is just used as a mirror for the project.

Requirements
============

To install the project you need ``composer`` to be installed and inside your ``$PATH``.
Otherwise run ``make install-composer`` to install composer.

At least PHP 7.1 is required.

Installation
============

Run::

    make install

Afterwards the :ref:`configuration-mappingFile` is required.
