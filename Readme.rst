About
=====

Our goal is to provide an automated migration for TYPO3 updates.

This should include source code modifications like adjusting old legacy class names to new ones.

Requirements
============

- ``composer`` needs to be installed and inside your ``$PATH``.

Installation
============

Run::

    make install

and copy the ``vendor/composer/autoload_classaliasmap.php`` generated by ``composer`` in your TYPO3
installation to ``LegacyClassnames.php`` in the root of this project.

Usage
=====

Run::

    ./vendor/bin/phpcbf <path>

This will run the auto fixer recursive for ``<path>`` fixing all issues.

Afterwards you should run::

    ./vendor/bin/phpcs <path>

To get information about possible issues that were not autofixed.

What's included?
================

Currently we can migrate calls to old legacy class names of the TYPO3 core like ``Tx_Extbase...`` to
new ones like ``\TYPO3\Extbase\...``. This is done for:

- PHPDocuments, like Includes and annotations for IDEs.

- Inheritance like ``extends`` and ``implements``.

- Static calls like ``t3lib_div::`` to ``\TYPO3\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility``.

- Typehints in methods and function like injects.
