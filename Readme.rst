About
=====

Our goal is to provide an automated migration for TYPO3 updates.

This should include source code modifications like adjusting old legacy class names to new ones.

Requirements
============

- ``composer`` needs to be installed and inside your ``$PATH``.

Installation
============

Run::

    make install

Copy the ``vendor/composer/autoload_classaliasmap.php`` generated by ``composer`` in your TYPO3 installation to ``LegacyClassnames.php`` in the root of this project.

Usage
=====

Will follow.
