Our goal is to provide an automated migration for TYPO3 updates.

This should include source code modifications like adjusting old legacy class names to new ones.

The official project home page can be found at https://git.higidi.com/Automated-TYPO3-Update/automated-typo3-update .
Please open new issues and merge requests there. You can login with your Github account.

Github is just used as a mirror for the project.
